        Rowing trainings are known for being physically demanding and mentally challenging, often requiring early morning sessions that begin before sunrise.
        These trainings typically involve a mix of on-water practice to refine technique and timing, as well as land-based workouts such as ergometer (rowing machine) sessions, weight training, and cardio conditioning.
        Athletes train multiple times a week, sometimes twice a day during peak season, to build endurance, strength, and teamwork.
        Discipline, consistency, and time management are essential, especially for students balancing academic responsibilities.
        While the training can be tough, it helps rowers develop a strong work ethic, resilience, and a deep sense of team commitment.
