        A typical rowing training program is carefully structured to build endurance, strength, technique, and race-day performance over a season.
        It usually begins with a base phase focused on aerobic conditioning through long, steady-state rows on the water and ergometer, combined with bodyweight exercises and light gym work.
        As the season progresses, the program shifts to include more high-intensity intervals, strength training in the gym (such as squats, deadlifts, and core work), and technical drills to improve stroke efficiency and boat balance.
        Most rowers train 6‚Äì10 times per week, with morning water sessions, afternoon erg or gym workouts, and regular team meetings or video reviews. Weekly schedules often include rest or recovery days and cross-training activities like cycling or swimming to reduce injury risk.
        Closer to regattas, the focus turns to race preparation, including sprint pieces, starts, and race simulations, helping rowers peak at the right time.
